        <p>
          A ton of questions knock my head when I ponder over the most familiar
          word <strong class="blue">Life</strong>. A big question that is still
          bothering me is 'What is life, where do we belong? Do our existence is
          limited to the time period we live on this earth or it is somthing
          else that we are not aware of'? What if it is true whatever is written
          in ancient texts, Life is a compilation of numerous small journeys
          strung together. A life is a small portion of a big journey? Or Does
          it start with the birth and end with the death? This is a big question
          that is still unanswered. It is generally told that even the demigods
          doesnt know the mystrery of life and death. Why is it like that? Life
          is really a big mystery which noone knows how will it unfold? <br />
          A life starts and it ends. It doesnt ask from us when should it be
          started and when it should end. It seems to be controlling us
          completely without offering us any free will. A sanskrita sloka from
          Srimad Bhagavad gita which explains the cycle of birth and death which
          we are in from thousands of years and we dont know when it will end.
          When i do see myself and others, we are running behind something each
          and every moment. We never stop thinking achieving something that will
          make us happy even momentarily. I am trying to understand myself. What
          is the suitable way or path to follow so that we can live this life as
          it is expected. Can you imagine a situation, where you just took a
          birth. Do your existence has no meaning on earth? Do you find your
          meaning when you learn something? Who knows how long a life will go
          on? To ...Why the opening of the article is started with dots, if you
          noticed then you really understand why the title of the article is
          chosen such that. Our journey hasnt been started with this life. We
          have lived tons of life already and got birth again. how should it be?
          Who will decide? These questions everyone should keep asking. When
          will this life end, noone knows. So better to know the idea of
          observing yourself time to time, can ascend you the staircase of life
          one step ahead. Get on the first step of knowing yourself. So to say,
          explaining our journey of life can be very confusing. As we can not
          express our experiences in words sometimes. Even we maybe forgetting
          the moments, a part of us will be living it one way or the other. My
          thoughts that come from a different paths and make me realise the
          importance of the things that i avoided before. It ensure me also that
          it is the right time to understand these things.
        </p> -->

        <!-- <h3>Ideas</h3>
        <p>
          Our aim of hearing someone decides what we are going to learn. If we
          do not decide anything then this is kind of an open problem. The most
          prominent one is you will get the ideas regarding what you will be
          going through at that time. Who decides the aim, is it our desires to
          achieve something?
        </p> -->
        <!-- <h3>Thoughts</h3>
        <p>
          How this life should be lived? Everyone is living according to their
          own belief system but do they really test their believe system before
          applying them. Do they keep doing testing it time by time and checking
          if it really pass the test or it causes trouble to society? Today the
          world is the consequence of those who are able but keep living those
          old belief systems which has been rotten already for current
          generation. Noone knows what will be consequenses. After a long time
          when the time starts showing the fruits of the actions.
        </p> -->
        <h4>Note</h4>

        <p>
          If someone is feeling pride in their job that is completely
          ridiculous. I believe one should take pride if they really want to, in
          the scenarios which are common in all the jobs. Just like how they are
          behaving with the people around. How properly they use their time and
          respect other's time.
        </p>
        <p>
          What ever you are trying to understand, you should be skeptic on other
          suggestion and thoughts. Test it first and confirm by yourself.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <h3>Birth and death</h3>
          When I see all around, I see many kind of people such as some young,
          same aged people, elder and old. Of course the world did not start
          when i took birth and it is not going to end when I will die. We can
          consider having birth as some kind of journey which starts at some
          point of time and end at some point of time. I believe, we all are
          familier with the cycle of birth and death. If not, then spend some
          time on this earth and observe the world all around you then read this
          article if you are interested. People say there is definitely a reason
          for taking birth and completion of our work decides our death. Well,
          many dont even get to know for what work they came here and what they
          did thier whole life so that their end time has come. Many people dont
          even see all the four stages of their life. Noone knows the procedure
          of birth. We only know what we can see. Some physical process put us
          into a big box which is kind of provide us all the necessary things
          for growth. Who created this process? I do not know what kind of
          thought the creator had in mind while producing us. When somebody
          takes birth on this earth, one has to go through the nine months
          formation process; Why this made necessary? This maybe the a scrafice
          from the mother side. How this is a scrafice? A person who is
          investing is one year period along with few years of post birth period
          in taking care of someone which is not necessary how long going to
          work. Why someone cant come directly? We took birth at some point of
          time in this era. At the earlier days, we do not understand anything
          and it take sometime to understand the working of this world at least
          superficially. We are not aware of what we go through. The situation
          which are developing around us, we get ourself absorbed and keep
          wandring into that. I was just feeling to understand myself more. What
          do i really love investing mmy time on? There are many questions that
          do keep ask from ourself but forget after sometime because we get
          indulged in our dauly activities and forget to take out some time to
          ponder on these questions.
