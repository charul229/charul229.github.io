        <h2>A journey of life</h2>
        <p>
          <input
            type="date"
            id="start"
            name="trip-start"
            value="2023-06-01"
            min="2023-01-01"
            max="2023-12-31"
          />
          ....Why the opening of the article is started with dots, if you
          noticed then you really understand why the title of the article is
          chosen such that. Our journey hasnt been started with this life. We
          have lived tons of life already and got birth again. how should it be?
          Who will decide? These questions everyone should keep asking. When
          will this life end, noone knows. So better to know the idea of
          observing yourself time by time, can take you to the other stage of
          life. Get on the first step of knowing yourself. So to say, explaining
          journey can be very complicated. As we can not express our experiences
          in words sometimes. Even we maybe forgetting the moments, a part of us
          will be living it one way or the other. My thoughts that come from a
          different paths and make me realise the importance of the things that
          i avoided before. It ensure me also that it is the right time to
          understand these things.
        </p>

        <h3>What we are here for?</h3>
        <p>
          Let my try to recollect what i was thinking about this small script.
          Why brought you here? The understanding of being here tell you
          something about your resposibility. Does it encourage you for taking a
          proper action? What is it that keep you alive, keep you motivated in
          doing whatever you are doing? There are tonnes of questions that we
          can ask from ourself, the interesting part is, what action we take to
          understand that question and do some brainstorming to come up to
          something valuable. Does it really worth asking these questions and
          spending some time to gather some thoughts to reach to some valuable
          form of understanding. We hardly find people to encourage us taking
          part in these kind of small detour from our normal journey of life.
          Let me tell you, it is worth time spending to explore these uncharted
          areas because who knows what we can found out.
        </p>

        <h3>Ideas</h3>
        <p>
          Our aim of hearing someone decides what we are going to learn. If we
          do not decide anything then this is kind of an open problem. The most
          prominent one is you will get the ideas regarding what you will be
          going through at that time. Who decides the aim, is it our desires to
          achieve something?
        </p>
        <h4>Note</h4>
        <p>
          What ever you are trying to understand, you should be skeptic on other
          suggestion and thoughts. Test it first and confirm by yourself.
