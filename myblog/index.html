        <h2>A journey of life</h2>
        <p>
          ....Why the opening of the article is started with dots, if you
          noticed then you really understand why the title of the article is
          chosen such that. Our journey hasnt been started with this life. We
          have lived tons of life already and got birth again. how should it be?
          Who will decide? These questions everyone should keep asking. When
          will this life end, noone knows. So better to know the idea of
          observing yourself time by time, can take you to the other stage of
          life. Get on the first step of knowing yourself. So to say, explaining
          journey can be very complicated. As we can not express our experiences
          in words sometimes. Even we maybe forgetting the moments, a part of us
          will be living it one way or the other. My thoughts that come from a
          different paths and make me realise the importance of the things that
          i avoided before. It ensure me also that it is the right time to
          understand these things.
