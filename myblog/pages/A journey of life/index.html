        <p>
          A ton of questions knock my head when I ponder over the most familiar
          word <strong class="blue">Life</strong>. A big question that is still
          bothering me is 'What is life, where do we belong? Do our existence is
          limited to the time period we live on this earth or it is somthing
          else that we are not aware of'? What if it is true whatever is written
          in ancient texts, Life is a compilation of numerous small journeys
          strung together. A life is a small portion of a big journey? Or Does
          it start with the birth and end with the death? This is a big question
          that is still unanswered. It is generally told that even the demigods
          doesnt know the mystrery of life and death. Why is it like that? Life
          is really a big mystery which noone knows how will it unfold? <br />
          A life starts and it ends. It doesnt ask from us when should it be
          started and when it should end. It seems to be controlling us
          completely without offering us any free will. A sanskrita sloka from
          Srimad Bhagavad gita which explains the cycle of birth and death which
          we are in from thousands of years and we dont know when it will end.
          When i do see myself and others, we are running behind something each
          and every moment. We never stop thinking achieving something that will
          make us happy even momentarily. I am trying to understand myself. What
          is the suitable way or path to follow so that we can live this life as
          it is expected. Can you imagine a situation, where you just took a
          birth. Do your existence has no meaning on earth? Do you find your
          meaning when you learn something? Who knows how long a life will go
          on? To ...Why the opening of the article is started with dots, if you
          noticed then you really understand why the title of the article is
          chosen such that. Our journey hasnt been started with this life. We
          have lived tons of life already and got birth again. how should it be?
          Who will decide? These questions everyone should keep asking. When
          will this life end, noone knows. So better to know the idea of
          observing yourself time to time, can ascend you the staircase of life
          one step ahead. Get on the first step of knowing yourself. So to say,
          explaining our journey of life can be very confusing. As we can not
          express our experiences in words sometimes. Even we maybe forgetting
          the moments, a part of us will be living it one way or the other. My
          thoughts that come from a different paths and make me realise the
          importance of the things that i avoided before. It ensure me also that
          it is the right time to understand these things.
        </p>
        <h3>What we are here for?</h3>
        <p>
          This is really interesting to notice that we are burdened with the
          ideas then how can we live a life peacefully. At least there is some
          free will on what we can think about. What brought you here? The
          understanding of being here tell you something about your
          resposibility. Does it encourage you for taking a proper action? What
          is it that keep you alive, keep you motivated in doing whatever you
          are doing? There are tonnes of questions that we can ask from ourself,
          the interesting part is, what action we take to understand that
          question and do some brainstorming to come up to something valuable.
          Does it really worth asking these questions and spending some time to
          gather some thoughts to reach to some valuable form of understanding.
          We hardly find people to encourage us taking part in these kind of
          small detour from our normal journey of life. Let me tell you, it is
          worth time spending to explore these uncharted areas because who knows
          what we can found out.
