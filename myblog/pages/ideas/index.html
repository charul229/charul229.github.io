          Our aim of hearing someone decides what we are going to learn. If we
          do not decide anything then this is kind of an open problem. The most
          prominent one is you will get the ideas regarding what you will be
          going through at that time. Who decides the aim, is it our desires to
          achieve something?
        </p> 
        <h2>Unknown</h2>
        <p> Exploring the unknown...does it really look simple when we say it or it is really a simple task...'Unknown' word does it ring a well to you? Do we always fear from unknown because it may bring unpleasant things to you. We always fear from unknown. What it is going to bring in our life and the impact it is going to have in the root level it is very hard to predict. Our life is an unknown territory which is given to us to explore it. So what is coming to us is also fully unknown. It is wonderful as well as mysterious to know what is going to happen ahead.
