          <h2>Moving contact line dynamics</h2>
          Moving contact line phenomenon is investigated through experimental
          observations. Experiments were conducted using custom built setup. The
          flow configurations emerged near the contact line were captured using
          high-speed camera and analyzed using PIV technique.

          <h2>Cavitation bubble dynamics</h2>
          The cavitation phenomenon is investigated through a combination of
          experimental, simulation, and theoretical approaches. Experiments are
          conducted using the spark discharge method and are recorded with
          high-speed photography. For simulations, the open-source software
          OpenFOAM is utilized.
