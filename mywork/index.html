        <p>
          This is the first paper which explains the dynamics of moving contact
          line in two phases. The model aims to clarify that no-slip boundary
          condition causes non-integrable singularity at the contact line. Their
          study reports two parameters namely viscosity ratio and dynamic
          contact angle to be flow characterizing parameters. The key inference
          from the theory was that more viscous fluid largely shows a rolling
          motion near the moving contact line.

        <p>
          This paper explains the theoretical models developed till that data do
          not precisely predict the dynamics occurring near the moving contact
          line. There is a second approach to spreading which involves zero bulk
          flow of the liquid but instead postulates that molecules from the
          liquid near the contact-line jump across and attach to the substrate
          effectively moving the contact line forward; this gives the molecular
          kinetic theory (MKT). HDT and MKT... HDT works for free spreading of
          drop as there are only natural time scales are invloved in the problem
          but in forced spreading case there is one more time scale involves
          which is related to relaxation which causes the dynamics to be
          different from free spreading case. For forced spreading case, MKT
          works well.

        <p>
          This paper explains the mechanism of hydrodynamic assist which helps
          to prevent the air entrainment in advancing contact line motion. It
          delays the wetting failure by increasing the critical speed at which
          failure occurs. It is simply the degree to which the flow influences
          the dynamic contact angle that increases during forced wetting.

          This paper reports a slip model which is a spatially varying along the
          solid surface near a moving contact line. After empploying biharmonic
          governing equation and standard boundary equation, they came up with
          secular equation and using friction and shear stress balance near the
          contact point, they made it a well posed problem. They ultimately
          obtained MKT solution with formulation.

          This is an extension of earlier study of liquid slippage near a

          reported flow fields near a contact line. They claimed that if n is
          complex then moffatt vorticed might be observed near the moving
          contact line. A number of questions are pointed out on the complex
          values of n and other model pararmeter b and r_star which are
          important in the study of moving contact line. r_star which is a real
          distance over a solid surface coming up complex which limits the model
          to keep the n value to be real only.

          the single phase study of Kirkinis and Davis 2014. The study reports
          the flow fields with different values of n namely, complex values and
          real values. When real values of n are considered then Moffatt
          vortices got disappeared and rolling motion and split streamline
          motion can be observed.

          This paper employs constant slip near a moving contact line. The
          region near a contact line is divided into three namely, inner region
          which is slip dominated, outer region which is geometry dependent and
          intermediate region which bridges the two regions. The study relates
          the dynamic contact angle to the capillary length and slip length
          which further modified to predict the interface shape. The idea of
          stagnation point is also mentioned.
