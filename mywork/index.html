        >
        <p>
          This is the first paper which explains the dynamics of moving contact
          line in two phases. The model aims to clarify that no-slip boundary
          condition causes non-integrable singularity at the contact line. Their
          study reports two parameters namely viscosity ratio and dynamic
          contact angle to be flow characterizing parameters. The key inference
          from the theory was that more viscous fluid largely shows a rolling
          motion near the moving contact line.

          Dussan and Davis, 1974,JFM, examined the kinemtaics of moving contact
          lines in general and showed that contact line motion is impossible if
          no-slip condition holds and showed that drop rolls along the solid.

        <p>
          This paper explains the theoretical models developed till that data do
          not precisely predict the dynamics occurring near the moving contact
          line. There is a second approach to spreading which involves zero bulk
          flow of the liquid but instead postulates that molecules from the
          liquid near the contact-line jump across and attach to the substrate
          effectively moving the contact line forward; this gives the molecular
          kinetic theory (MKT). HDT and MKT... HDT works for free spreading of
          drop as there are only natural time scales are invloved in the problem
          but in forced spreading case there is one more time scale involves
          which is related to relaxation which causes the dynamics to be
          different from free spreading case. For forced spreading case, MKT
          works well.

        <p>
          This paper explains the mechanism of hydrodynamic assist which helps
          to prevent the air entrainment in advancing contact line motion. It
          delays the wetting failure by increasing the critical speed at which
          failure occurs. It is simply the degree to which the flow influences
          the dynamic contact angle that increases during forced wetting.

          Eggers and stone have shown that Lmac/Lmic is a velocity dependent
          parameter. (A Characteristic lengths at moving contact lines for a
          perfectly wetting fluid: the influence of speed on the dynamic contact
          angle. J. Fluid Mech. 1999). They obtained the dependence of
          (Lmac/Lmic = a Ca^(2/3)) on the capillary number for perfectly wetting
          liquids. They assumed a nearly flat interface near contact line ato
          apply the lubrication assumption for describing liquid motion. They
          have considered the pressure variation caused by capillary and
          vanderWaals forces.
