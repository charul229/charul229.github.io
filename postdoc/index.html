        In <strong>Stokes' first problem </strong>, fluid is driven by suddenly
        accelerating plate and in Stokes' second problem, plate is oschillated
        with a certain frequency. <strong>Second problem </strong> is the
        simplest unsteady problem which has analytical solution of Navier-stokes
        equation. Stokes' wave theory is also important to understand.
        <strong>Solitary wave </strong> which is also called as soliton is a
        unique wave which has distinct properties from other waves first
        observed by Russel. Other scientist did not agree as they could not
        figure it out. Later <strong>KDv equation</strong> is developed which
        provided the solution. <strong>Inverse scattering method</strong> is
        used to solve non-linear partial differential equation.
        <br />
        Please understand the concept of circulation, velocity gradient and
        strain in fluids. Know the use of tensors in fluid dynamics.

        <strong>Pyroclastic flows:</strong> A pyroclastic flow is a fast-moving
        current of hot gas and volcanic matter that flows along the ground away
        from a volcano at average speeds of 100 km/h but is capable of reaching
        speeds up to 700 km/h. Chute flows: steep sided flow, Debris flows,
        Granular flows in a rotating drum.

        Diiferent atmospheric layers in the outer earth, troposphere,
        stratosphere, mesosphere, thermophere and exosphere and last that is
        magneto sphere. Troposphere is the layer where our most of the air and
        moisture stays, cloud and turbulence in flows stays. Here the
        temperature decreases with height. In stratosphere, ozone layer exist.
        It absorbs ultrasonic radiations from the sun so the temperature
        increases in the layer as height increases. Mesosphere again shows
        decrease in temperature. Thermosphere is an important layer which is
        also called ionosphere because here ions forms because of radiations
        from son, here temperature increases with height. This layer casues the
        radio transmission possible on our planet.

        <strong> Prandtl-Glauert singularity </strong> was the prediction of a
        set of infinite forces that would limit aircraft from actually breaking
        the sound barrier.

        The current work in fluid dynamics are on the interaction of the object
        at the interface of two immissible fluid phases. The ball which is kept
        in place at some distance from the interface and left. The ascend
        towards interface and clear the surface then jump into the air. The
        dynamics of the complete process is need to be understood. Fluid imapct,
        impact of fluids on floating bodies.

        Please read about sonic boom, vapor cone, bow shock, instabilities
        (crow, kelvin-helmholtz, Rayleigh plateau, Saffman- Taylor, Kelvin
        waves, Hydraulic jump.), thunder and lightning. Dynamics behind dust
        cloud or dust dynamics. Please add flow measurement devices to
        understand their way of working in the real problems.

        Concept of vapor pressure, kelvin equation and capillary

        The concept of pyrolysis and hydrolysis. <br />
        The biogeochemical cycle includes nitrogen cycle and carbon cycle. How
        the cycles are being altered by human activities (human impact is
        dominating on earth- anthroprocene transition from holocene where human
        were trying to live with whatever resources were available).

        Know about electro osmosis. An example of the phenomenon is rising damp

        Read about Plasma, wake, bow shock and crocos' theorem. Read about how
        scattering happens and difference in their types.
