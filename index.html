      <h2 class="title">About</h2>
      <p class="intro">
        I am a research scholar in the Department of Mechanical and
        Aerospace Engineering, IIT Hyderabad. I am currently working on the
        problem on "a moving contact lines dynamics" with Dr. Harish N. Dixit and Dr.
        Lakshamana D. Chandrala. My area of interest has been in fluid dynamics
        problems. I believe I have developed some expertises in experimental
        tactics and understanding of the theoretical constructs of the problems.
        My home town is Alwar, Rajasthan. I finished all my schooling there
        only. I finished my bachelor from NIT Allahabad. I finished my masters
        from NIT Warangal in Thermal and Fluid Engineering. I am much interested
        in reading books.
