      <p class="intro">
        Hello! I am currently a PhD student in the Department of Mechanical and
        Aerospace Engineering, IIT Hyderabad. I am working on a problem "a study
        of flow dynamics occurring very near a moving contact line" with
        <a href="https://people.iith.ac.in/hdixit/">Dr. Harish N. Dixit</a> and
        <a href="https://iith.ac.in/mae/lchandrala/"
          >Dr. Lakshamana D. Chandrala</a
        >. The moving contact line is studied in great detail with the help of
        experimental observations and theoretical constructs. An experimental
        technique, PIV is used to explore the flow dyanmics happening near a
        contact line. For more details, check out a pre-print of a recently
        submitted paper in the publication tab above. Moreover, i am interested
        to work in a wide range of fluid dynamics problems. Other than PIV
        tehcnique, I have explored other useful optical techniques like
        shadowgraphy, schlieren imaging, holography, interferometry etc.
